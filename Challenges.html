                    <p><u>Description:</u> I wasn't used to using conditional operators inside formulas. So I tried it, but didn't quite solve the Kata. But then I saw the mistake: <b>Parenthases are missing!</b><br> So remember: If you are using a conditional operator in a  formula, <b>always use parentheses!</b></p>

                        <p>I learned about the conditional operator from my best friend, a programmer. So I wanted to learn and use it! <br>At first, I struggled a bit, but then I got it right, and the Kata I used it on was completed!</p>

                        <p>Due to sickness in the beginning of the week I was a bit slowed down within the Kata process.
                            <br>Additionally I worked a lot on the website which then became my main focus, thus lacking my work with Codewars.</p>
