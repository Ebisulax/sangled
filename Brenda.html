                <h1>Experience this week:</h1>
                    <p align="center" class="introtext">Very happy with my group and working together but yeah sadly I was only there 1 day of the week to work together. Luckily it was possible this week to work from home since we all did the Katas ourselves. The Katas were pretty weird and sometimes hard to understand what it wants from me so it took me multiple hours for actual basic tasks.</p>
